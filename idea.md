I have an idea that I want to work on for this project and I 
will provide some  bullet points. Can you help me create a 
paragraph with a travel marketing tone and embellish on details 
that really bring this idea to life?
 
It should capture the following points. Do not give this destination 
a name. Focus on what makes this destination unique. We will brand 
and name this experience later.

- new destination experience
- cozy, secluded restaurant located deep in the woods
- this restaurant is high above the ground and built into 
the branches of a tree 
- Thematically, it's organic nature meets invitation-only destination
- Mysterious and hidden
