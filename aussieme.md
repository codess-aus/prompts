A vibrant digital illustration in a semi-realistic style showing a team of diverse girls in the Australian bush. They are gathered around a camp-style setup with laptops open, coding together. The girls are dressed in bright coloursâ€”red, yellow, orange, black, and white. The background features eucalyptus trees, native Australian flora, and a clear blue sky. The mood is energetic and hopeful, symbolizing teamwork and innovation. One girl is pointing at a screen showing a world map, while another is typing code. A kangaroo and a kookaburra are visible in the background, adding a local touch.
