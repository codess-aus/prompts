A magical library in pixel art style, floating in the clouds. The scene is bright and whimsical, with books gently levitating and glowing with soft light. Each book has a unique symbol on its cover representing coding languages like Python, JavaScript, and HTML. A group of diverse girls in colorful outfits explore the library, with one girl pointing at a book that opens to reveal glowing code. The sky is a dreamy blue with sparkles and floating islands in the distance.
